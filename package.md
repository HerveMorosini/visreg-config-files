Copy the scripts from the included `package.json` to your package.json file
If you already have a "test" script, you can call this whatever you want
e.g. `"wdio": "wdio"` would let you run `npm run wdio` instead of `npm test`
If you rename it, be sure to update the "Running Tests" section in the VISREG-README.md file to match
